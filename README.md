Project Euler Problem Solutions

Instead of simply writing functions to solve individual problems, we'll try to create generic re-usable classes.

Each problem will be solved in it's own project.  These are mostly simple problems and serve as simple code samples.  For
more complex code samples, please see other projects.

What is Project Euler?  https://projecteuler.net/

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just 
mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use 
of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to 
delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
