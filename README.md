Project Euler Problem Solutions (aka short code samples)

What is Project Euler?  https://projecteuler.net/

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just 
mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use 
of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to 
delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

The problems are solved using unit tests in project EulerMSTest.  Most of the problem solving logic is int he library EulerLib.

Both projects have been updated to .NET 8.0
